## Interpretation of Feature Importance

From the feature importance graph, we can see that **Overall Quality (`OverallQual`)** and **Total Square Footage (`TotalSF`)** are the most important factors in predicting house prices. This makes sense because:
- **OverallQual** describes how good the materials and finishes in the house are. Better quality means a higher price.
- **TotalSF** tells us how big the house is. Bigger houses usually cost more.

## Model Performance Comparison

### 1. Linear Regression
- **R²:** **0.87** → The model explains **87%** of the changes in house prices.
- **RMSE:** **31,326** → The average prediction error is about **$31K**.
- **Good accuracy**, but it might not handle complex patterns well.

### 2. Decision Tree
- **R²:** **0.76** → It explains **76%** of the price changes.
- **RMSE:** **42,781** → Errors are larger compared to Linear Regression.
- **Overfits the data**, meaning it learns details too well but struggles with new data.

### 3. Random Forest (Best Model)
- **R²:** **0.88** → It explains **88%** of house price variations.
- **RMSE:** **29,870** → It has the lowest error, meaning better predictions.
- **Best model overall**, as it captures important patterns and avoids overfitting.

## Real-World Meaning
- **Higher quality homes and bigger houses cost more**, which matches real-life real estate trends.
- **Newer houses and renovated homes sell for higher prices**, as expected.
- **Lot size matters, but not as much as quality and space**

### Conclusion
The **Random Forest model** is the best choice here. It predicts prices more accurately while avoiding common mistakes like overfitting.
